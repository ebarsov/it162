               <p>It was a family decision to create <strong>Pampushka Restaurant</strong> to share the rich <strong>Ukrainian heritage</strong> that we grew up with and learned to nurture and love. Food is a central component of the <strong>Ukrainian experience.</strong> <strong>Ukrainian hospitality</strong> revolves around <strong>good food and plenty of it.</strong> Our doors of hospitality officially opened October 15, 2012, in Some City. We have now celebrated 10 years of business â€” how quickly the time has passed!  It is undeniable that times have been particularly tough for the restaurant industry since the COVID-19 pandemic hit us.  We continue to strive and struggle to keep our doors open for service despite all the obstacles the post-pandemic presents.</p>
					<p>We hope that <strong>Pampushka Restaurant</strong> makes every person of Ukrainian heritage proud to bring guests to dine here. We hope that for anyone whose first experience with <strong>Ukrainian cuisine</strong> is <strong>Pampushka Restaurant</strong> that it is a positive and memorable event.</p>

 <p>Hi there! My name is Elena Barsov. And I'm not looking for easy ways. I seek new challenge, so, I'm here to acquire a new profession. Last year, I was studying application development. But I like web design more. I hope I will be able to master this profession.</p> 
 <p>Since I am just beginning my ascent to this peak, it can be compared to the dawn in my life. Now I have a second chance to gain a new profession. </p>
 <p>I love my family and traveling. It is my passion!I love small and cozy Europe  and  travel a lot there. I also like the nature and wide expanses of America. All States are different and do not resemble one another.</p>

 <p> Every day is a new beginning with a new dawn.</p>
